    Stanford University is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Stanford's undergraduate program is the most selective in America.
    Due to its academic strength, wealth, and proximity to Silicon Valley it is often cited as one of the world's most prestigious universities.
    The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S. Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891.
    There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate students and another four professional schools. Students compete in 36 varsity sports.
