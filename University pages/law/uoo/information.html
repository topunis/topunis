The Faculty of Law, Oxford is the law school of the University of Oxford which has a history of over 800 years of teaching and writing law. It is unique in its use of personalised tutorials, in which students are taught by faculty fellows in groups of one to three on a weekly basis,[1] as the main form of instruction in its undergraduate and graduate courses. It offers the largest doctoral programme in Law in the English-speaking world.
Oxford has produced a significant number of luminaries in law and politics, including a United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, twelve Lord Chancellors, nine Lord Chief Justices, nine UK Supreme Court Justices and twenty-two law lords; several heads of state around the world.
