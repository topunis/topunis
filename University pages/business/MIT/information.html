    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is often ranked as one of the world's most prestigious universities.

    Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.

    The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, but more recently ranked Number 4 all over the world for its Arts.
